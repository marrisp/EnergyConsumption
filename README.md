**Capstone Project Name**: Predicting Smart Home Energy Consumption using ARIMA

**Project Topic:** The objective of this project is to build predictive models using ARIMA for smart home future energy consumption based of past time series data. It delves into predicting how weather variations, like temperature and precipitation, influence household energy consumption. It analyzes a dataset combining one-minute smart meter readings (kW) from various appliances over 350 days with corresponding weather data. By leveraging time series analysis, it aims to build a model that predict future energy needs, promoting more efficient energy use for both homeowners and utility companies through informed decision-making and grid stability management.



**Research Question:** Can ARIMA model predict energy consumption on time-series research dataset?

**Hypothesis: **
Null Hypothesis (H0): A predictive ARIMA model cannot be made from the time series research dataset.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): A predictive  ARIMA model can be constructed from the time series research dataset at a model accuracy > 70%.


**Context:** The homes are filled with appliances that constantly consume energy. This consumption fluctuates significantly based on weather patterns. For instance, heating needs surge in winters, while air conditioner usage spikes in summers. This project aims to leverage the power of smart meter data and weather information to predict these changes in energy consumption.
The project investigates the effectiveness of deep learning models in forecasting energy consumption. A model will be built using ARIMA. The core question is to establish an ARIMA model in predicting future energy consumption with greater accuracy and lower error. The models' performance will be evaluated using a specific dataset of energy consumption time series.

The Project Goal is, to develop a robust model that can accurately predict energy consumption patterns based on the combined analysis of smart meter data and weather information.
And the Potential Benefits would be,
Improved Energy Efficiency: By understanding how weather influences energy consumption, homeowners and utility companies can develop strategies to optimize usage. This could involve implementing smart appliances or adjusting thermostat settings based on weather forecasts.
Demand Forecasting for Utilities: Accurate forecasting of energy demand allows utility companies to prepare for peak usage periods and allocate resources efficiently, ensuring grid stability and reducing blackout risks.
Personalized Energy Management: The model's insights can be used to develop personalized recommendations for homeowners, empowering them to make informed choices about their energy consumption.




**Data Source:**

	**Data:** These models will be trained & validated using the opensource data provided by Kaggle
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taranvee/smart-home-dataset-with-weather-information/data), specifically the energy consumption time-series data.

**Smart Meter Data: **The dataset collected over 350 days from a smart meter. This data will include energy consumption readings in kilowatts (kW) for various household appliances, recorded at one-minute intervals.
Weather Data: The weather data for the corresponding region encompassing the 350 days. This data includes temperature, precipitation, humidity, and other relevant weather attributes.




**Data Gathering:** 
	The Smart Home dataset is the public dataset acquired from Kaggle, that contains 32 fields. Data is downloadable in .CSV format contains 503911 unique records. Out of all, there is 1 record contains mismatched data. The data is in generally very good shape, being published for public consumption and data analysis. The facial emotion data in the file are complete.


**Data Analytics Tools and Techniques: **
		**Tools:**
Jupyter Notebook (Google Collab)
datetime
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
sklearn
statsmodels
pmdarima
keras

**Techniques**
The analysis will begin by exploring the energy consumption and weather data to uncover trends and seasonality. 
Next, the time series data will be decomposed to isolate seasonal effects and trends.
To ensure the data is ready for analysis, various cleaning steps (like removing errors, renaming columns, and handling missing values) will be performed. 
The data will then be split into 70% training and 30% testing sets. 
The training data will be used to build and train time series forecasting models, which will then predict future values for the unseen testing data. 
Then the models' effectiveness will be compared using mean squared error (MSE) and identify the one with the lowest error. 
This optimal model will be further evaluated based on its Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) compared to actual data. 
If the MAPE is below 20%, indicating good forecasting accuracy, the model will be used to predict future energy consumption for smart homes.
Eventually the ARIMA model accuracy will be to decide if the null hypothesis should be accepted or rejected. 


**Justification of Tools/Techniques: **
	
These libraries, when used together in a Jupyter Notebook environment, provide a powerful toolkit for data scientists to tackle various tasks in the data science workflow, from data cleaning and manipulation (pandas, numpy) to analysis and modeling (statsmodels, pmdarima, sklearn, keras) to visualization (matplotlib).


**Data Analysis Tools**
Python provides a powerful and versatile environment for data analysis. The Anaconda environment offers a comprehensive solution, including tools like Jupyter Notebooks which facilitate a enhanced and work on the go approach. Jupyter Notebooks allow seamless integration of Python code and narrative explanations within a single document, promoting an iterative approach to data exploration and analysis.
Several Python libraries will be instrumental in this project:
Pandas: This library organizes the data into a DataFrame, a powerful table structure that enables efficient data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Often used by Pandas and other libraries, NumPy provides a foundation for numerical computations.
Matplotlib: This library allows creating various customizable data visualizations to explore the data and present findings.
Scikit-learn: This versatile library offers functionalities like splitting data into training and testing sets, calculating forecast errors (e.g., MSE), and performing other essential tasks.
Statsmodels: This library provides tools for time series decomposition and data visualization related to time series analysis.
Pmdarima: This library simplifies the process of fitting ARIMA/SARIMA models with its optimized auto_arima() function, eliminating the need for manual iteration through different models.


While Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are alternatives, their values depend on the study's units. The energy consumption data for this analysis consists of numerous minute-level data points for a single year. MAPE offers a more intuitive measurement in this scenario. Standardized on a 0-100% scale, MAPE represents the percentage error between predicted and actual values. Specific situations might require additional considerations, but a common benchmark in business forecasting considers a MAPE below 20% a "good" model, and under 10% a "very good" model. Therefore, an effective model for this project will have a MAPE below 20%, indicating good forecasting accuracy.



**Project Outcomes:** The project will generate models using technique like ARIMA/SARIMA that can forecast the energy consumption. Prediction with effectiveness demonstrated by comparison report of MSE/RMSE with lower value & mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of under 20% to reject the null hypothesis. Ultimately, the project will provide insights into the most effective approach for accurate forecasting in this domain.
